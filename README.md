# PyCon 2019 Recap

A collection of highlights from some of my favorite talks and events I attended at [PyCon 2019](https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/) in Cleveland.

I don't cover it in this presentation, but I'd recommend also checking out my PyCon 2019 talk on [Getting Started Testing in Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ysyWk-ox-8) :)
